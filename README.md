# bitcamp2022

My project that I made for bitcamp 2022.
I didn't submit it in time, but I would still like to post it here :)


#What is it?
Basically, it stores your friend's names, numbers, birthdays, and a message that you would like to send them on their birthday.

Whenever you load the page, it tells you if anyone's birthday is today (it was made in a rush, so it's hardcoded to EST timezone for now).
You then type in the passcode to send messages to your friends.
